## NotesApp

This project is a simple note-taking application designed to practice and implement the theory of LocalStorage in JavaScript. The application allows users to:

- Create and delete notes.
- Store notes locally using LocalStorage.

Technologies Used:

- JavaScript: The primary programming language used for implementing the application's functionality.
- HTML: Used for structuring the user interface and defining the layout of the application.
- CSS: Utilized for styling and enhancing the visual appearance of the application.

By building this project, I will gain hands-on experience working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while also exploring the concept of persisting data locally using LocalStorage. This application serves as a practical demonstration of how to integrate these technologies to create a functional and user-friendly note-taking tool.
